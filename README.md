    # CornershopÂ´s Data Science Test

For this data science test, I performed 4 different models: Linear Regression, deep neural network, random forest and XGBoost.  In this case, the model that worker the best was deep neural network and followed closely by linear regression.  This might mean that the relationship between the variables is near to linear or maybe we need more data to be able to gain advantage by using complex models.

I dumped predictions using this 4 models, but the predictions to be taken into account are the ones made with the deep neural network (DNN.csv) as it is the one that performed the best.
